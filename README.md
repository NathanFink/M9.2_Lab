# CS408 - Lab9.2
## Author Nathan Fink
## Overview

This project updates a pre-existing ballbounce file that displays multiple balls bouncing across the screen. We change thsi to a game with an evil cirlce that when touching a ball deletes it and decrements a ball count. We can move the ball with wasd and it stops before going off the screen. We use alot of the predefined functions and just change certain aspects of them for the evilCircle function. We also create a shape class to hold positons of elements.

## Sources and Credits
Most of this assignment wasn't too difficult, and the clear instructions made it pretty esy to follow what needed to be added or changed to each function. The only portion I got stuck on was the ball count since I couldn't figure out how to like link it the paragrpah element.
These 2 sources gave me some direction on how to do the last part of the ball count
